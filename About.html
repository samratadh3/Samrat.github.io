        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Samrat Adhikari, a +2 science student committed to building a strong foundation for my future. I’m currently studying subjects like physics, chemistry, cmathematics, and computer science at KEF Secondary School, Pokhara, Kaski, Nepal, which fuel my curiosity and problem-solving mindset.</p>
        <p>
            Education is about more than just knowledge—it's about developing the skills that will guide me in thefuture. I’m focused on enhancing my critical thinking and technical abilities, preparing for the challenges that lie ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of my studies, I’m passionate about coding, graphic designing, trading, and learning about AI. I also have a keen interest in watches and cars—exploring their intricate designs and how they combine craftsmanship with technology. Whether it's experimenting with coding, creating visual designs, or diving into the world of AI, I’m always learning and evolving.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in building a diverse skill set and preparing for a future where I can contribute to innovation in multiple areas. I’m excited about the possibilities ahead and always looking for new ways to learn, collaborate, and make a difference.
